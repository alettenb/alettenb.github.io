Hi, I'm Alex! Currently, I am a senior at the California Institute of
Technology, where I study both Computer Science and Business, Economics, 
and Management. I'm a developer by trade, but I love anything that involves 
creation and learning. On the side, I try to hone my photography skills
or improve myself athletically, whether that's in running, jumping, snowboarding,
surfing, or many other activities. Well, that's me in a nutshell. I hope you
enjoy looking over the website and exploring my projects!
